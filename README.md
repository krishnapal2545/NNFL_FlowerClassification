# Neural Network for Binary Classification of flower Rose and Sunflower

The dataset contains 2400 images of flowers. The data collection is based on the data flickr, google images, yandex images. You can use this dataset to recognize flowers from the photo. The pictures are divided into two classes: rose and  sunflower. For each class there are about 1200 photos.
 
Total data: 2400 images
Train data: 50% of total data
Validation data: 25% of total data
Test data:  25% of total data
